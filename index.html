		<p style="font-family:Arial;">Lead poisoning can happen to someone of any age, but has the most devastating life
long consequences when it happens in early childhood.  There are two main sources of childhood lead poisoning:
lead paint and lead plumbing. Both were
standard before 1950 and lead paint was standard until 1979. Lead paint causes many more cases
of poisoning than lead plumbing and typically causes even more as houses age and paint flakes.
The threshold for lead poisoning used to be set at a blood lead level (BLL) of 10 mcg/dL, but
recently has been lowered to 5 mcg/dL as it was found that even lower levels caused long term
health effects. <br>

The percentage of older housing differs markedly from one county to another in
Wisconsin, so we would expect the amount of childhood lead poisoning to differ as well. One
question is whether the counties that should be testing the most children for lead poisoning
(because they are the counties with the greatest percentage of aging housing) are the counties
that are testing the most. A second question is whether the counties that have the highest
percentage of children testing
positive for lead the ones who really have the greatest number of lead poisoned children, or
is it just that those counties screen more of their children? </p>
